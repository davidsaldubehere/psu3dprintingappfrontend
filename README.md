Hi,

This is the code for the brand new PSU 3D printing club app. It is available on the App Store [here](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/psu-3d-printing-club/id6474882720). Email me at das6859@psu.edu to be added as an Android tester. 

I am planning to also release the backend code for the app, but I need to make sure that I have removed all of the sensitive information from the code before I do so. Having the source code out also opens up the possibility of exploits that I may not have thought of, so I need to make sure that I have done my due diligence before I release the code. The backend code is written in Python and uses the Django Rest Framework and token authentication. I have the visual api enabled, so if you have an account, you can go to the following link to see the api: [api](https://psuwebdevclub.pythonanywhere.com/tasks/)
