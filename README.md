Hi,

This is the code for the brand new PSU 3D printing club app. Currently it is in the app store review process, and I will update this README when it is available for download.

I am planning to also release the backend code for the app, but I need to make sure that I have removed all of the sensitive information from the code before I do so. Having the source code out also opens up the possibility of exploits that I may not have thought of, so I need to make sure that I have done my due diligence before I release the code. The backend code is written in Python and uses the Django Rest Framework and token authentication. I have the visual api enabled, so if you have an account, you can go to the following link to see the api: [api](https://psuwebdevclub.pythonanywhere.com/tasks/)
